    "content" : "Node.js is a powerful, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Initially released in 2009 by Ryan Dahl, Node.js has rapidly gained popularity among developers due to its event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O model, which makes it highly efficient for building scalable and real-time applications. One of the key features of Node.js is its ability to handle concurrent connections with ease, making it ideal for building web servers, APIs, and networking applications. Node.js utilizes the V8 JavaScript engine from Google Chrome, resulting in fast code execution and performance. Node.js has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as Express.js, which simplify the process of building web applications by providing robust features and tools. Its package manager, npm (Node Package Manager), is the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries in the world, enabling developers to easily integrate third-party modules into their projects. Moreover, Node.js facilitates full-stack JavaScript development, allowing developers to use the same language on both the client and server sides, which enhances code reusability and developer productivity. In conclusion, Node.js has revolutionized server-side programming with its lightweight, efficient, and scalable architecture, making it a preferred choice for building modern web applications.",
